## Additional Notes

- If version is excluded, latest is assumed.
- If repo is excluded, <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins> is assumed.
- If you are installing multiple versions of the same plugin, the last one in this list will be set as global version.
- Version matching is done using asdf's `latest:<version>` format, so inputting `python:3.11` will install the latest stable version of Python 3.11
